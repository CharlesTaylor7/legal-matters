When writing controllers, please validate permissions first before running model validation.

React Router with the data mode API. We are NOT using the framework or plugins or SSR. 

Please use NavLink with the className={({ isActive})} helper to enable menu-active
please do not use loaders, make new custom hooks in api.ts that leverage react-query to call the api. Consult @instructions for the api structure.

Please do not use fake data on the frontend.

Please write components as functions with a default export like this

```tsx
export default function FooComponent(props: FooProps) {
...
}
```

The api is served from the host as the app. Please do not set fetch "credentials": true.



## Error handling
Do not put error handling inline.
There is a global error handling system using an axios interceptor to show a toast message. That will be sufficient in 99% of cases. 

## Loading states
Use <div className="spinner" />

## forms
We are using axios and custom hooks making http requests for the server.
But when making a form still make sure client side form validation is run.

Set required attrbiute when relevant, and use the title attribute if the input has a custom pattern for validation.
