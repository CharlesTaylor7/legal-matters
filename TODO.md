## Issues
- [ ] Can't input phone number on ios mobile
  - Input masking on phone numbers
- [ ] Phone number validation
- [ ] Admin login broken

## UI Tweaks
- [ ] empty Banner stretches across the screen. Maybe shrink it down a bit?
- [ ] logout button is not aligned to navigtation items


## nice to have
- [ ] RBAC policies
- [ ] playwright 
- [ ] Auto populate swagger examples with valid values
- [ ] Matter status should be text not enum, for the sake of swagger docs
- [ ] Path alias for typescript


# Cut for time
- automated testing:
  - either Jest & React Testing Library 
  - or  Playwright for e2e

- phone number validation that works for international numbers. 
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-phone-number
  - https://www.nuget.org/packages/libphonenumber-csharp
- pagination for frontend
- searching
- filtering
