## Issues
- [x] Modals are mutated with dom manip
- [x] deletew button uses window confirm instead of modal
- [ ] error handling is not up to snuff and revise client side handling



## nice to have
- [ ] RBAC policies
- [ ] playwright 
- [ ] Auto populate swagger examples with valid values
- [ ] Matter status should be text not enum, for the sake of swagger docs
- [ ] Path alias for typescript


## UI Tweaks
- [ ] Banner stretches across the screen. Maybe shrink it down a bit?
- [ ] paginated card view for customers
- logout button is not aligned to navigtation items
- login/signup Input box highlight overlaps label text. Removed focused style?
- [ ] client side phone number validation
- [ ] server side phone number validation?
