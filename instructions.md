Take-Home Assignment: Legal SaaS Customer & Matter Management
Objective
Your task is to build a simple backend API and UI for managing customers and their associated matters. The project should follow RESTful API principles and include a basic frontend to interact with the system. 
If you are applying for a BE-focused position, spend more time on the backend; if a FE-focused position, spend more time on the front end.
What You'll Build
	â€¢	A backend API with authentication and customer/matter management.
	â€¢	A simple frontend UI to list, create, and view customers and matters.
Technical Requirements
Backend
	â€¢	Use C#/.Net 8, Ruby on Rails, or a Node.js framework
	â€¢	Database: PostgreSQL (use an ORM like Prisma, Sequelize, EF, AR, or Knex, etc)
	â€¢	Authentication: Cookie or JWT-based authentication
	â€¢	Routes should follow RESTful best practices (see API routes below)
	â€¢	Implement basic error handling (invalid input, missing records, etc.)
	â€¢	Write at least one database migration to initialize the schema
Frontend
	â€¢	Use React with TailwindCSS (or Next.js if preferred)
	â€¢	Build a minimal UI with:
	â€¢	A login form
	â€¢	A list of customers (clicking a customer should show their matters)
	â€¢	A form to create new customers
	â€¢	A form to create new matters under a customer
API Routes to Implement
Authentication
	â€¢	POST /api/auth/signup â†’ Create a new user (email, password, firm name)
	â€¢	POST /api/auth/login â†’ Login and receive JWT
	â€¢	GET /api/auth/me â†’ Return authenticated user info (JWT protected)
Customers
	â€¢	GET /api/customers â†’ Retrieve a list of customers
	â€¢	POST /api/customers â†’ Create a new customer (name, phone)
	â€¢	GET /api/customers/{customer_id} â†’ Retrieve details of a customer
	â€¢	PUT /api/customers/{customer_id} â†’ Update a customer
	â€¢	DELETE /api/customers/{customer_id} â†’ Delete a customer
Matters
	â€¢	GET /api/customers/{customer_id}/matters â†’ Retrieve matters for a customer
	â€¢	POST /api/customers/{customer_id}/matters â†’ Create a matter
	â€¢	GET /api/customers/{customer_id}/matters/{matter_id} â†’ Retrieve matter details

Requirements for Submission
	â€¢	GitHub Repository with:
	â€¢	A README.md file explaining how to run the project
	â€¢	API documentation (can be simple markdown or Postman collection)
	â€¢	.env.example file for environment variables
	â€¢	Deliverables:
	â€¢	Backend API with working endpoints
	â€¢	Basic UI with customer and matter listing + creation
	â€¢	Authentication implemented
	â€¢	PostgreSQL database setup with migrations
	â€¢	Any bonus features (if time permits)

Evaluation Criteria
Category
Criteria
Code Quality
Is the code modular, readable, and well-structured?
RESTful API Design
Are the API routes well-structured and follow REST principles?
Database Schema
Is the PostgreSQL schema properly normalized?
Authentication & Security
Are passwords hashed? Does JWT authentication work properly? Or does the cookie use proper security (given its development mode, would it in production?)
Error Handling
Are errors (e.g., invalid input, missing records) handled gracefully?
UI/UX Considerations
Does the UI provide a clean and intuitive experience?
Documentation
Is there a clear README with setup instructions?
Bonus (Not Required)
Extra features like customer/matter search, better UI, testing, or role-based access

Time Expectation
	â€¢	This task is designed to be completed within 3-6 hours.
	â€¢	We donâ€™t expect a fully polished productâ€”focus on writing clean, structured, and working code.
	â€¢	If you run out of time, leave a README note explaining whatâ€™s missing and how you'd improve it.

Bonus Ideas (Optional)
If you have extra time, feel free to enhance your submission:
	â€¢	Search & Filtering for customers and matters
	â€¢	Unit Tests (Jest or Mocha for backend)
	â€¢	Docker Support (Dockerfile + docker-compose)
	â€¢	Role-Based Access (e.g., admin vs. standard users)
	â€¢	Improved UI/UX (Better styling, real-time updates)

Submission Instructions
	â€¢	Upload your code to a GitHub repository (public or private, but share access).
	â€¢	Include setup instructions in your README.md.
	â€¢	Email us with:
	â€¢	The GitHub repo link
	â€¢	A short note on what you completed and what you'd improve with more time.

What Happens Next?
	â€¢	We'll review your submission and evaluate it based on the criteria above.
	â€¢	If you pass, we'll invite you for a live code review + system design discussion.

Final Thoughts
This assignment is not about perfectionâ€”itâ€™s about seeing how you think, structure code, and solve problems. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask questions! ðŸš€
